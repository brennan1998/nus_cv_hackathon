Object_count1) We attempted to process the images by using various techniques such as adaptive gaussian blur, thresholding, canny and contouring with opencv 2) We proceeded to use ‘len’ to count the number of objects and appended each object_count into a list to be transferred to the csv file. Handwriting_count3) After finding the object_count, we wanted to identify the handwritten number.4) We started by using using CNN but we encountered a cardinality error. 5) Subsequently, we attempted to use bayes network model with a 40k dataset of numbers from 0 to 9 BUT failed because of the a shape error.Anomaly detection6) Due to the limited amount of time, we are unable to proceed to this step.Note of appreciation: Team Codaract would like to thank you guys for organising such an event while having to juggle with school.  :)
